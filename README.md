## What I Build

I design and implement systems at the boundary between classical software engineering and applied AI — specifically:

- **Autonomous agent loops** that plan, execute, and self-correct over multi-step coding tasks
- **Retrieval pipelines** that ingest messy real-world documents and serve precise, ranked context to LLMs
- **CLI/TUI tooling** that runs locally, requires no cloud dependency, and treats safety as a design constraint

My engineering approach is shaped by one conviction: language models are only as useful as the infrastructure surrounding them. I focus on that infrastructure.

### Operon — Autonomous Code Intelligence Agent

[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/qasimio/Operon?style=flat-square&color=2E6DA4)](https://github.com/qasimio/Operon/stargazers)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10+-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/qasimio/Operon)
[![Textual](https://img.shields.io/badge/TUI-Textual-FF69B4?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/qasimio/Operon)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/qasimio/Operon?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/qasimio/Operon/blob/main/LICENSE)

A terminal-native agent that operates on a full repository — not just individual files. Operon builds a persistent, hash-gated symbol graph across the entire codebase, then uses it to execute multi-file refactors, generate structured documentation, and answer questions about execution flow.

Key engineering decisions:
- **Deterministic-first REVIEWER**: verifies changes by comparing disk hash to diff memory snapshot before any LLM call — eliminates hallucinated confirmation
- **CRUD fast-path**: structured operations (import insertion, variable renaming, comment placement) handled via `tokenize` and `ast` without LLM — removes the most common failure mode of small local models
- **5-tier surgical diff engine**: SEARCH/REPLACE patching with cascading fallbacks from exact string match through fuzzy multi-line tolerance
- **Mandatory approval gate**: no filesystem write occurs without explicit human confirmation; timeout auto-rejects to prevent hang
- **9-provider LLM router** with hot-reload config — model switching takes effect on the next call, no restart

### MQNotebook — Enterprise RAG System

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/qasimio/MQNotebook)
[![LlamaIndex](https://img.shields.io/badge/LlamaIndex-8A2BE2?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/qasimio/MQNotebook)
[![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-Streamlit-FF4B4B?style=flat-square&logo=streamlit&logoColor=white)](https://mqnotebook.streamlit.app)

A retrieval system designed for the documents that most RAG demos ignore: scanned PDFs, PPTX speaker notes, multi-sheet Excel files. The engineering focus is retrieval correctness under real document conditions.

Key engineering decisions:
- Custom OCR pipeline (Tesseract + Poppler) handles flattened text and image-only pages
- Hybrid search: dense vector retrieval re-ranked by a Cross-Encoder, yielding **~40% precision improvement** over cosine similarity alone
- Session-isolated storage handler resolves Windows file-locking failures (WinError 32) in persistent vector stores
- Context injection optimized to **reduce token usage by ~60%** without precision loss

### DevShelf — Vertical Search Engine (from First Principles)

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat-square&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/qasimio/DevShelf)
[![IR](https://img.shields.io/badge/Information_Retrieval-555555?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/qasimio/DevShelf)

A search engine for Computer Science literature built without Lucene or ElasticSearch. The goal was to understand retrieval at the data-structure level before building RAG systems on top of it.

Key engineering decisions:
- Positional inverted index with **O(1)** keyword lookup via custom hashing
- Offline Indexer pre-processes corpora at build time, pushing query latency to **sub-millisecond**
- O(L) Trie for prefix-completion; Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
- TF-IDF scoring with behavioral re-ranking

The classical IR knowledge from DevShelf directly informs the hybrid search design in MQNotebook.

### foldr — File Automation CLI

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/foldr?style=flat-square&color=2E6DA4)](https://pypi.org/project/foldr/)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/foldr?style=flat-square&color=brightgreen)](https://pypi.org/project/foldr/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/foldr/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/qasimio/foldr/blob/main/LICENSE)

A published command-line tool for organizing large file collections by extension. Designed for data pipeline preparation — cleaning raw datasets before ML ingestion.

```bash
pip install foldr
foldr ~/Downloads --dry-run   # preview before any move
foldr ~/Downloads             # execute
```

Engineering emphasis: dry-run architecture previews all I/O before execution; conflict resolution prevents overwrite; directories are never touched.
