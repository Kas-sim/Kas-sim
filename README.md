## ⚡ The Philosophy: Engineering from First Principles
I don't just write scripts; I engineer **systems**.
My work sits at the intersection of **High-Performance Computing**, **Distributed Systems**, and **Generative AI**. I believe that to truly master Software 2.0 (AI), one must first master the metal (Systems, Memory, and Infrastructure).

* **Core Focus:** Building Search Engines, Neural Networks, and Distributed Architectures from scratch.
* **The Workbench:** Arch Linux (Hyprland), Neovim (Lua), and automated Bash/SSH workflows.
* **Current Mission:** Bridging the gap between Classical Information Retrieval and Semantic Vector Search.

## 🚀 Flagship Engineering

### 📚 [DevShelf: Distributed Search Engine](https://github.com/Kas-sim/DevShelf)
> [Read the Case Study](https://kas-sim.github.io/projects/devshelf) | _I didn't use ElasticSearch. I built the search engine from scratch._

A production-grade vertical search engine for Computer Science literature, engineered from scratch without external dependencies (No Lucene, No Solr).
* **The Architecture:** Split-Stack design with **Offline Indexing** (Batch Processing) and **Online Querying** (Memory-Mapped I/O).
* **The Math:** Custom **Positional Inverted Index** for **O(1)** retrieval, ranked by a hybrid formula (TF-IDF + User Popularity + Ratings).
* **The Scale:** Streams content via a "Serverless CDN" architecture; deployed to 200+ users.

### 🤖 [Baby GPT: Generative Text Engine](https://github.com/Kas-sim/BabyGPT)
> *A neural network that learns to "dream" English from scratch.*

Trained a character-level Language Model on *Alice in Wonderland* without pre-trained weights or APIs.
* **Deep Learning:** Dual-Stack **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) network built in TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Engineering:** Implemented custom **Temperature Sampling** to control generation stochasticity and a bespoke Tokenizer.
* **Outcome:** The model learned grammar, punctuation, and stylistic mimicry from raw probability distributions.
